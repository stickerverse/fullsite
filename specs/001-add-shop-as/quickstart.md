# Quickstart: Shop Integration Testing

**Feature**: Integrate Shop Directory as Sticker Shop
**Purpose**: Validate integration implementation through step-by-step testing
**Prerequisites**: Implementation completed, development server running

## Quick Validation Steps

### 1. Navigation Integration Test
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:5173
# Expected: Main application loads successfully
```

**Validation Steps**:
1. Navigate to homepage (`/`)
2. Click on shop navigation link
3. **Expected**: Smooth transition to shop interface at `/shop`
4. **Expected**: Shop displays sticker products
5. Click browser back button
6. **Expected**: Return to homepage

**Success Criteria**: ✅ Navigation works bidirectionally without errors

### 2. Shop Component Functionality Test
```bash
# From shop page (http://localhost:5173/shop)
```

**Validation Steps**:
1. Verify sticker products are displayed
2. **Expected**: See grid/list of sticker products with images
3. **Expected**: All images load successfully (no broken images)
4. Interact with product filters (if available)
5. **Expected**: Filtering works and updates display
6. Click on a sticker product
7. **Expected**: Product interaction works (details, selection, etc.)

**Success Criteria**: ✅ All shop functionality preserved and working

### 3. Asset Loading Validation
```bash
# Open browser developer tools (F12)
# Go to Network tab
# Navigate to /shop
```

**Validation Steps**:
1. Monitor network requests in developer tools
2. **Expected**: All sticker assets load successfully (200 status)
3. **Expected**: No 404 errors for missing assets
4. Check console for JavaScript errors
5. **Expected**: No error messages in console

**Success Criteria**: ✅ All assets load without errors

### 4. Design Consistency Test
**Validation Steps**:
1. Compare shop page styling with main application
2. **Expected**: Consistent navigation bar/header
3. **Expected**: Consistent color scheme and typography
4. **Expected**: Responsive design works on different screen sizes
5. Test mobile view (DevTools responsive mode)
6. **Expected**: Mobile navigation works correctly

**Success Criteria**: ✅ Visual consistency maintained across application

## Detailed Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Journey
**Given**: User visits the application for the first time
**When**: User navigates from homepage to shop
**Then**: 
- Shop loads within 3 seconds
- All product images are visible
- Navigation remains accessible
- User can browse products smoothly

### Scenario 2: Returning User Journey  
**Given**: User has previously visited the shop
**When**: User navigates to `/shop` directly via URL
**Then**:
- Shop loads directly without redirect
- Previous functionality is preserved
- All assets cached and load quickly

### Scenario 3: Error Handling
**Given**: Network connection issues or slow loading
**When**: User navigates to shop
**Then**:
- Graceful loading states shown
- Fallback images used if assets fail
- No application crashes or blank pages

## Performance Validation

### Load Time Metrics
```bash
# Use browser developer tools Performance tab
# Or lighthouse audit
npx lighthouse http://localhost:5173/shop --view
```

**Performance Targets**:
- First Contentful Paint: < 2 seconds
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 3 seconds
- Total page load: < 5 seconds
- No layout shift during loading

### Asset Optimization Check
```bash
# Check asset file sizes
du -sh src/assets/shop/stickers/*
```

**Expected**: Individual sticker images < 500KB each

## Debugging Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Shop page shows blank screen
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, verify asset paths

**Issue**: Images not loading (404 errors)  
**Solution**: Verify assets moved to correct location, check import paths

**Issue**: Navigation not working
**Solution**: Check React Router configuration, verify route definitions

**Issue**: Styling inconsistencies
**Solution**: Check CSS conflicts, verify Tailwind classes, inspect component styles

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check asset file structure
find src/assets/shop -name "*.png" | head -10

# Verify build output
npm run build
ls dist/assets/

# Check development server logs
npm run dev --verbose
```

## Success Validation
