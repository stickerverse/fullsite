**Feature Branch**: `001-add-shop-as`  
**Created**: 2025-01-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add @shop/ as the new stickershop in the main application"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature: Integrate existing shop directory into main application
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Users browsing/purchasing stickers
   ’ Actions: Navigate to shop, browse products, view details
   ’ Data: Existing shop component and assets
   ’ Constraints: Must integrate with existing navigation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should replace existing /shop route or create new route?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should shop integrate with existing checkout flow?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User can access shop from main navigation
   ’ User can browse sticker products within unified experience
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Integration with existing React Router setup
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Shop component, Navigation system, Routing
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties about routing integration"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users can access a dedicated sticker shopping experience from the main application navigation. They should be able to browse available sticker products, view product details, and have a seamless experience that feels integrated with the overall application design and functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the main application homepage, **When** they navigate to the shop section, **Then** they see the sticker shop interface with available products
2. **Given** a user is browsing the sticker shop, **When** they interact with product listings, **Then** they can view product details and imagery
3. **Given** a user is in the shop section, **When** they want to return to other parts of the application, **Then** navigation remains consistent and accessible

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the shop component fails to load?
- How does the shop integrate with existing application state management?
- How does navigation behave when transitioning between shop and other sections?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST integrate the existing shop directory as an accessible route within the main application
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain the existing shop functionality and user interface
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to navigate to the shop section from the main application navigation
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve all existing sticker product assets and imagery
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure consistent navigation and user experience between shop and other application sections
- **FR-006**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: routing approach - replace existing /shop or create new route path?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: integration with checkout flow - how should shop connect to existing checkout?]

### Key Entities
- **Shop Component**: The main sticker shopping interface containing product listings and interactions
- **Navigation System**: The application's routing and navigation structure that provides access to the shop
- **Product Assets**: The collection of sticker images and associated metadata in the shop assets directory
- **Application State**: The shared state management between shop and other application sections
